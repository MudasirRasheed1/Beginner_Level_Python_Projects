# Hangman Game Project

This Hangman Game project is designed to help you learn and practice fundamental concepts of Python programming, including modules, loops, conditionals, and variable scope. The game is implemented using two separate files: one containing data (a list of 100 tech-related words) and the other containing the code.

## Project Structure

- `hangman.py`: This file contains the code for the Hangman game.
- `data.py`: This file contains the data, specifically a list of 100 tech-related words that make the game challenging and interesting.

## How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```

## Game Instructions

- The game will prompt you to enter your name.
- You will be welcomed to the Hangman game and asked to guess a word related to technology.
- You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.
- After each guess, the game will provide feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- If you correctly guess the word, you win! If you run out of attempts, you lose.
- You can choose to play again after each round.


Enjoy playing Hangman and happy coding!
