# Number Guessing Project

During the initial days of learning Python, I encountered a simple math trick that my friend played with me. The trick involves guessing a number between 1 and 9, multiplying it by 3, and then again by 3. After these operations, my friend asked me to determine whether the resulting number in my mind is a single digit or a double digit.

Here's the interesting part:
- If the number is a single digit, the answer is 9.
- If the number is a double digit, the sum of its digits is always 9.

Inspired by this math trick, I decided to create a simple project around it.

## How to Play

1. **Guess a Number:**
   - Choose a number between 1 and 9 in your mind.

2. **Mathematical Operations:**
   - Multiply the chosen number by 3.
   - Then, multiply the result by 3 again.

3. **Determine the Answer:**
   - If the resulting number is a single digit, the answer is 9.
   - If the resulting number is a double digit, calculate the sum of its digits, and the answer is 9.

## Example

- Suppose you choose the number 4.
- Multiply by 3: 4 * 3 = 12
- Multiply by 3 again: 12 * 3 = 36
- Since 36 is a double digit, calculate the sum of its digits: 3 + 6 = 9.
- The answer is 9.

Have fun playing with this intriguing math trick! Feel free to incorporate it into your Python learning journey.
